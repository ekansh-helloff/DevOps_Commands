========================================================= ADVANCED COMMANDS ========================================================================

gh repo delete <username>/<repo_name> --confirm

git merge feature                  #Combines branches preserving history
git rebase main                    #Rewrites history by moving commits, Makes commit history clean & linear, Dangerous if branch is shared (history rewrite)
git checkout production ==> git cherry-pick 9f8de2a        # Cherry-pick is used for selectively applying commits across branches without merging the full branch.

{In hotfix or emergency production support, cherry-pick is widely used. For example, if a fix is done on a feature branch but must go to production immediately,
I'll cherry-pick only that commit to main or release. If there is a conflict, I resolve it, add the file, and continue. This avoids merging unnecessary incomplete
development code into production.}
